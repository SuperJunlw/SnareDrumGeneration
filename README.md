# SnareDrumGeneration
We will use machine learning to generate realistic and high-quality snare drum samples. We use a GAN-based model (waveGAN) and a diffusion-based model (diffWave) to generate the drum samples. Due to hardware constraints, the generated samples were downsampled from 44.1 kHz to 22.05 kHz. A custom audio signal processing architecture was developed to reconstruct the original resolution for the generated samples. Our goal is to generate drum sounds that are comparable to existing commercial samples, enabling digital music producers to access a wider variety of high-quality drum samples without the financial burden of purchasing large and costly sample packs.
